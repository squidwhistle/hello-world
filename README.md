# hello-world
My first repository (resources, ideas, useful snippets and notes)

This is my first readme. I'm an aspiring dev, currently learning Advanced Javascript (self-taught), and after that, I will be starting on React. My background is non-traditional, and so this is learning process is a big leap. I have moments of doubt, but I am determined. Git used to intimidate me. I'm finally putting that aside and learning it. So this is all a work in progress, and there is not much here - but its existence signifies jumping off a cliff that is actually a launching pad. It's scary, but in the end, there will be buoyancy.
